# ⚠️  DEPRECATED since fw-4.26.0 / cli-3.23.0 (#237).
# `straymark charter drift` is now native Rust and no longer invokes this
# script — the command works on Windows-native (no WSL, no Git Bash). This file
# is kept as an unmaintained reference prototype (it seeded `charter_files.rs`
# and the native drift logic, validated byte-for-byte by the equivalence test
# suite) and will be removed in a future release. Prefer `straymark charter
# drift`; running this script directly still works but receives no fixes.
#
# check-charter-drift.sh — flag declared-but-not-modified files at Charter close.
#
# Ported from Sentinel scripts/check-plan-drift.sh (validated empirically with
# zero false positives across PLAN-05 retrospective + PLAN-06 prospective).
# StrayMark surface: Charters live at .straymark/charters/NN-slug.md (this is
# the rebrand of Sentinel's docs/plans/NN-*.md layout).
#
# This script catches drifts of OMISSION (file declared in Charter, never touched)
# and SCOPE EXPANSION (file modified but not declared). Both kinds were caught by
# external auditors in PLAN-05 (F4 evaluator_test gap, F5 architectural hallucination,
# modified extras like wire_gen.go).
#
# Usage:
#   .straymark/scripts/check-charter-drift.sh <charter-file> <git-range>
#
# Examples:
#   .straymark/scripts/check-charter-drift.sh .straymark/charters/01-format-v4.md fd65e87..473f6e0
#   .straymark/scripts/check-charter-drift.sh .straymark/charters/01-format-v4.md HEAD~1..HEAD
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no drift detected (or only documented out-of-scope extras)
#   1 — drift found that needs attention (declared-but-not-modified or
#       undocumented scope expansion)
#   2 — usage error
#
# Output is human-readable; the agent reading this should take action by either
# completing the missing work or documenting the drift in the AILOG under
# "## Risk" as `R<N+1> (new, not in Charter)`.
#
# Note: `straymark charter drift` (cli-3.7.0+) wraps this script and adds
# AILOG-awareness — it suppresses alerts on paths already documented as R<N>
# in any AILOG referenced by the Charter's `originating_ailogs` frontmatter.
# Invoking this script directly is fine but you'll see those documented-drift
# alerts as well; use the CLI for the de-noised view.
