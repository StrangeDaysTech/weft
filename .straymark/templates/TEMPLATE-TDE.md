# TDE: [Technical Debt Title]

> **IDENTIFIED BY AGENT**: Prioritization and assignment require human decision.
>
> **Activation triggers** (any one suffices — file as `R<N> (new, not in Charter)` in an AILOG instead if none apply): heritage from a prior Charter, applies to multiple modules/Charters, requires a dedicated Charter outside the current scope envelope, or requires human prioritization/assignment the agent cannot decide alone. See `.straymark/00-governance/AGENT-RULES.md` §3 for the full disambiguation.

## Summary

[Brief description of the identified technical debt]

## Debt Type

- [ ] **Code**: Hard to maintain, duplicated, or poorly structured code
- [ ] **Architecture**: Suboptimal architectural decisions
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Problematic configurations or dependencies
- [ ] **Documentation**: Missing or outdated documentation
- [ ] **Testing**: Insufficient coverage or fragile tests

## Prioritization Decision

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Prioritized by | [Name] |
| Date | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Assigned priority | [P1/P2/P3/Backlog/Will not resolve] |
| Sprint/Milestone | [If applicable] |
| Assigned to | [Team/Person] |
| Comments | [Notes] |

## Resolution

> Fill this section AND flip `status: identified → resolved` in the frontmatter when
> the debt described here has been addressed. Keep the document on disk — `resolved`
> is the canonical TDE terminal state; the file becomes audit history rather than
> being deleted. See DOCUMENTATION-POLICY.md §3 for the lifecycle semantics.
>
> Omit this section entirely while the debt is still `identified` / `accepted` /
> superseded — it is meaningful only at the terminal transition.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Resolved by | [Charter ID / PR / commit that paid the debt] |
| Date | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| Verification | [How was the resolution verified — tests, drift check, audit, etc.] |
| Notes | [Anything future readers should know, e.g. partial-resolution scope] |
